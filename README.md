# Gmail-self-hacking-toolkit
A python application(code) that appears to be a hacking tool for the user but instead hacks the user and send his data to you
The code is written in python and will require python packages preinstalled with tkinter on the host machine

when the code is executed, the user will be given an option to signin with gmail credentials before entereing into the hack panel
when the user enters his details, the details of his gmail is sent to me(edit with your gmail address in the code to receive it on your gmail), and he gets a notification of error in network and check the network again.
